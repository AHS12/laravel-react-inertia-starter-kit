# UI conventions: motion & feedback

This is the shared vocabulary for how the interface moves and how it tells the
user that something is happening. Keep it purposeful and short.

## Motion tokens

Defined in `resources/css/app.css` under `@theme` (Tailwind v4). Use the
utilities, never raw millisecond values.

| Token                       | Utility class       | Value   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| `--transition-duration-instant` | `duration-instant` | 90ms    |
| `--transition-duration-fast`    | `duration-fast`    | 140ms   |
| `--transition-duration-base`    | `duration-base`    | 200ms   |
| `--transition-duration-slow`    | `duration-slow`    | 300ms   |
| `--ease-standard`               | `ease-standard`    | cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1) |
| `--ease-emphasized`             | `ease-emphasized`  | cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1.15) |
| `--ease-exit`                   | `ease-exit`        | cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1) |

Two composed utilities cover the common case:

- `transition-smooth` — colors, background, border, shadow, opacity and
  transform over `--transition-duration-base` with `--ease-standard`.
- `transition-smooth-fast` — the same properties at `--transition-duration-fast`
  (row hover, small controls).

Guidance: UI state changes 120–220ms; layout/reveal 200–320ms; always
interruptible. Long-running work uses **ambient** motion only (progress
shimmer, pulsing live dot) — never motion that competes with reading.

## Reduced motion

`app.css` strips non-essential animation and transition duration when the OS
requests reduced motion. Use the Tailwind variants for targeted intent:

- `motion-safe:animate-*` — run only when motion is allowed (preferred for
  ambient/pulsing decoration, e.g. `LiveDot`).
- `motion-reduce:animate-none` / `motion-reduce:transition-none` — opt a
  specific element out (e.g. a progress bar that should snap).

## Feedback primitives

All live in `resources/js/components/feedback/`.

| Component | Use for |
| --------- | ------- |
| `TableSkeleton` / `TableBlockSkeleton` | table-shaped loading (`TableSkeleton` renders placeholder `TableRow`s inside an existing `TableBody`) |
| `ListSkeleton` | row/list surfaces (job activity, feeds) |
| `CardSkeleton` | KPI / metric card grids |
| `ChartSkeleton` | data-viz panels |
| `LiveDot` | pulsing live status (pipeline indicator, run headers); static when inactive and under reduced motion |
| `LiveRegion` | visually hidden `aria-live="polite"` region for status text |

### Skeleton vs spinner

- **Skeleton** when the shape of the incoming content is known and the wait is
  more than a blink (tables, lists, cards, charts). Prefer it for first loads
  and filter changes.
- **Spinner** for work whose result does not change layout — a submit button, a
  row-level action, a small inline refresh. Use the `Button` `loading` prop so
  the spinner is bound to the button's state.

### Buttons

`Button` accepts a `loading` prop. It renders a `Spinner`, sets `aria-busy` and
disables the button. Do not hand-roll `processing && <Spinner />` plus
`disabled={processing}`. For `asChild` buttons the spinner is not injected (the
slot owns the element) — `aria-busy`/`disabled` are still applied.

### Toasts

Import `toast` from `@/lib/toast`; never import `sonner` directly. It
centralises tones (`success`, `info`, `warning`, `error`), per-tone durations
(4s success/info, 6s warning, 8s error), `id`-based dedupe and an optional
`action`. Pass a stable `id` (e.g. `job-${id}`) when the same entity can
transition more than once, so repeated toasts replace rather than stack.

### Live regions

Long-running updates are announced politely, throttled to **stage changes and
completion only** — never every progress tick. Wrap the region with
`aria-live="polite"` (or render `LiveRegion`) and toggle `aria-busy` while work
runs. Never rely on color or motion alone: pair state with an icon and text.

### Optimistic updates

For list mutations (cancel, retry, delete), update locally first, keep the row
visible with an inline pending state (spinner/disabled), and reconcile on
success. On failure, revert the row and surface an error toast with an explicit
retry action — do not leave the list in an ambiguous state or block the page
with a global spinner.

## Loading / empty / error states

Every async region renders **exactly one** of four states. Never mix them and
never leave a failed region blank.

| Condition      | Primitive                         | When                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Loading        | `Skeleton` / `*Skeleton`          | shape is known and wait > a blink     |
| Empty (block)  | `EmptyState`                      | first load, or filtered to nothing    |
| Empty (inline) | `EmptyState variant="compact"`    | inside a card, lane or sheet          |
| Error (block)  | `ErrorState`                      | a region failed to load; offer retry  |
| Error / notice | `InlineAlert`                     | contextual message in a working UI    |

- **`ErrorState`** (`components/feedback/error-state.tsx`) takes
  `title`/`description` (already translated by the caller), `onRetry`
  (rendered as an `outlined` `Button` with the `loading` prop via `retrying`),
  an optional `action`, and `details` — the raw error string, disclosed behind
  a native `<details>` so stack traces never dominate the view. Use
  `compact` in cards.
- **`InlineAlert`** (`components/feedback/inline-alert.tsx`) is the
  contextual sibling: tones `info`/`success`/`warning`/`error` map to semantic
  tokens and to `role="status"` (info/success) or `role="alert"`
  (warning/error). It supports `title`, children, an `action` and a labelled
  `onDismiss` button. Reach for it for polling paused, cached-data and backoff
  notices — not for region failures.
- `--warning` / `--info` (`--color-warning`, `--color-info`, plus
  `-foreground`) are real semantic tokens: defined on `:root`, `.dark` and the
  high-contrast blocks; palette themes inherit the base values.
- Reserve `role="alert"` for real failures; do **not** re-announce it on every
  poll. For refreshing status text use the `LiveRegion`.
- Skeletons remain `aria-hidden`; pair every state with icon **and** text.
- Fixed labels used by the primitives — `Dismiss`, `Show details`,
  `Hide details`, `Retry` — live in all five `lang/app/*.json`.

## Charts

Charts are built on **Recharts v3** through the shadcn primitive
`components/ui/chart.tsx`. Use the typed wrappers in `components/charts/` rather
than composing Recharts directly, so colours, axes, tooltips, loading and empty
states stay consistent.

| Component | Use for |
| --------- | ------- |
| `ChartCard` | titled frame for any chart panel |
| `LineChart` / `AreaChart` | trends over time |
| `BarChart` | categorical comparisons (supports `stackId` stacking) |
| `DonutChart` | part-to-whole breakdowns (`nameKey` + `valueKey`) |

Conventions:

- **Series colours** come from `--chart-1…5` via `seriesColor()` /
  `buildChartConfig()` — they already adapt to dark, khaki, dracula and
  high-contrast palettes. Only pass `color` to override intentionally.
- **Format values with `lib/format.ts`** through `valueFormatter` (tooltip) and
  `xTickFormatter` / `yTickFormatter` (axes): dates via `formatDate`,
  durations via `formatHours`, counts via `formatNumber`.
- **States are automatic**: pass `isLoading` for `ChartSkeleton`, and the
  wrapper renders `EmptyState` when `data` is empty. Never render a bare axis
  with no data.
- **Values are raw** from page props (numbers, ISO dates); never send
  pre-formatted strings.
- **Reduced motion**: wrappers disable Recharts animation via
  `useReducedMotion()`; `ChartContainer` also gets a `role="img"` +
  `aria-label`.
- Keep `components/ui/chart.tsx` pristine (re-publishable); behaviour lives in
  `components/charts/*`.

## Accessibility

The keyboard/focus/contrast pass and its findings live in
[`accessibility.md`](accessibility.md). In short: the first tab stop is
**Skip to content** (targets `<main id="main-content">`), every icon-only
control needs an accessible name, and high-contrast mode overrides the chart,
ring, destructive and success tokens in addition to the base surfaces.
